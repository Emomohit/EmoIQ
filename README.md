## 1. Problem statement

Engineering students in India (especially at RGPV and similar universities) waste huge amounts of time every semester just **finding** study material. The real problems are:

- **Notes and PYQs are scattered** across random Telegram groups, Drive folders, WhatsApp forwards, and paid apps.
- **Quality is inconsistent.** The same subject has ten different PDFs — none of them aligned to the current syllabus.
- **Practice is missing.** Even after reading notes, students have no easy way to test what they actually understood.
- **Paid apps gate the basics.** Simple things — a quiz, a mock test, a good AI explanation — sit behind subscriptions most students can't afford.
- **No community.** Learning alone kills consistency. Most students give up in the first two weeks.

The result: bright students spend more time hunting for material than actually learning.

## 2. Why I built EMO Learners

I'm Mohit Ahirwar, an engineering student myself. I lived every problem in the list above. I've searched for PYQs the night before an exam, paid for apps that turned out to be locked, and watched friends drop out of coding because "it felt too hard alone."

I built EMO Learners because I wanted **one place** that a first-year student could open on their phone and immediately find:

- notes that match their syllabus,
- previous year questions,
- short quizzes to check understanding,
- a small daily coding habit,
- and a community that keeps them going.

Free. Always. No paywalls. No ads. No dark patterns.

## 3. How the project addresses the problem

Every feature maps back to a real student pain point.

| Student pain | EMO Learners answer |
| --- | --- |
| Notes scattered everywhere | `/resources` — branch and semester filtered notes and PYQs, uploaded by the founder / verified admins |
| No structured way to learn coding | `/courses` — full Python, Java, C, and DSA tracks with notes, code snippets, quizzes, and hands-on exercises |
| No practice after reading | `/practice` — quizzes and timed mock tests with instant feedback |
| No consistency | 30-day Python challenge with a streak tracker and daily lessons |
| Stuck on a concept at midnight | AI Helper — a Gemini-powered study assistant that explains topics in simple words |
| Learning alone is hard | Telegram + Instagram + YouTube community |
| Syllabus mismatch | RGPV Bhopal AICTE Flexible Curricula seeded across all branches and semesters |

## 4. Approach

### Product decisions

- **Student-first information architecture.** The whole app is organised around five things a student actually wants: Learn, Practice, Notes & PYQs, AI Helper, Community.
- **Plain English everywhere.** No jargon, no marketing fluff. Every button says what it does.
- **Mobile-first.** Most Indian students study on their phone. Every layout is designed for a 360 px screen first, desktop second.
- **Free forever.** No paywall, no "pro" plan, no ads. Community-supported.

### Technical decisions

- **TanStack Start (React 19 + Vite 7)** — full-stack framework with SSR, file-based routing, and server functions. Fast, type-safe, and good for SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — design tokens live in `src/styles.css` (`@theme`). No hard-coded colors in components.
- **Lovable Cloud (Supabase)** — Postgres, Auth, and private file storage. Row Level Security (RLS) on every table.
- **Gemini via Lovable AI Gateway** — the AI Helper runs server-side; the model key never touches the browser.
- **Framer Motion** — page transitions and micro-interactions with `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.

### Security decisions

- Row Level Security **enabled and enforced** on every public table with explicit `GRANT`s.
- The `study-materials` storage bucket is **private**. Files are served via short-lived signed URLs from a server function — no public direct links.
- Admin access is checked **server-side only** through the `has_role()` security-definer function and the `FOUNDER_ADMIN_EMAIL` project secret. The client is never trusted.
- Roles stored in a separate `user_roles` table (never on `profiles`) to prevent privilege escalation.
- All server function inputs validated with Zod.
- No secrets committed. Publishable keys only in `.env`; service role and admin email as server secrets.
- Strict HTTP security headers on every SSR response.
- Password sign-up uses the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) leaked-password check.

## 6. Features — the full list

Every feature below is live on the site. Each one is explained in plain English so a first-year student can tell exactly what it does.

### 6.1 Accounts & Auth (`/auth`, `/reset-password`)

- **Email + password sign-up.** No phone, no OTP, no "verify your college ID". Just email and a password.
- **Show / hide password toggle.** Eye icon on every password field so students can double-check what they typed on a phone keyboard.
- **HIBP leaked-password check.** If the password has ever appeared in a public breach, sign-up is blocked with a clear message. No weak passwords slip in.
- **Minimum length: 8 characters.** Enforced client-side and server-side.
- **Instant login after sign-up.** Email auto-confirm is on, so a new student goes straight to the dashboard — no "check your inbox" wall.
- **Forgot password (in-app reset).** `/reset-password` verifies the account's full name (set at signup) via a server function and lets the user pick a new password directly.
- **Persistent session** across refreshes via the Supabase JS client; auth state streamed through `src/lib/auth.tsx`.
- **Sign out** from the navbar dropdown on every page.

### 6.2 Home page (`/`)

- **Hero + countdown** to the next 30-day challenge cohort (SSR-safe — no hydration flicker).
- **Site-wide search bar** that jumps to notes, courses, quizzes, tests, or EMoIQ.
- **Quick-start cards**: Learn, Practice, Notes & PYQs, AI Helper, EMoIQ, Community.
- **Featured EMoIQ block** — flagged "New · AI" to surface the exam-strategy engine.
- **Live stats strip** — students, resources, quizzes, streaks.
- **Marquee banner** for community updates.

### 6.3 Notes & PYQs (`/resources`)

- **Two tabs**: Academics (branch-tagged PDFs) and AI Tools (curated links).
- **Filters**: Branch (CSE, IT, CY, AL, more) + Semester (1–8), aligned to RGPV Bhopal AICTE Flexible Curricula.
- **Fuzzy search** across title, subject, and tags — typos tolerated.
- **Subject cards** with unit-wise breakdowns.
- **Signed-URL downloads.** Files served via short-lived signed URLs from a server function — no permanent public link.
- **Bookmark any resource** with one tap; shows on the dashboard.
- **"Report a mistake"** widget on every resource card feeds the `feedback` table.

### 6.4 Courses (`/courses`, `/courses/$slug`)

Chapter-based courses. Every chapter ships with **notes + code snippets + inline quiz + hands-on exercise + YouTube deep-link**.

- **Python — Basic to Advanced** (CodeWithHarry, timestamped)
- **Java — Basic to Advanced** (`https://youtu.be/q6z_UCBM5Ek`)
- **C Language — Basic to Advanced** (`https://youtu.be/irqbmMNs2Bo`)
- **DSA — 20-chapter track** (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, backtracking, and more; see `src/lib/dsa-course.ts`)

Per-chapter mechanics:
- **Notes** in phone-friendly chunks.
- **Code snippets** with copy-to-clipboard.
- **YouTube deep-link** to the exact timestamp for that concept.
- **Inline quiz** (`QuizBlock.tsx`) — MCQs with instant right/wrong and explanations.
- **Hands-on exercise** (`ExerciseBlock.tsx`) — small coding task with expected output.
- **Progress tracker** per user; sidebar shows done and next.
- **Two-column reading layout** on desktop; single-column on mobile.

### 6.5 30-Day Python Challenge (`/challenge`)

- **Day 1 → Day 30 tracker** with streak counter, badges, and a personalized certificate preview.
- **Curriculum from a single 12-hour video** (`https://youtu.be/UrsmFxEIp5k`) so lessons stay consistent — no cross-tutor confusion.
- **Per-day card**: what you'll learn, time estimate, notes, code snippet, YouTube deep-link.
- **Local streak persistence** in `localStorage` — works even before login.
- **Aurora / glassmorphism** visuals with `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- **Restart & mark-complete** actions per day.

### 6.6 Practice hub (`/practice`, `/quizzes`, `/tests`)

One landing page that unifies three practice modes:

- **Quizzes (`/quizzes`, `/quizzes/$slug`)** — short MCQ sets, instant feedback, per-question explanations, final score.
- **Timed mock tests (`/tests`, `/tests/$slug`)** — countdown timer, review mode after submit, question-wise breakdown.
- **30-Day Python Challenge** — deep-linked for daily habit-building.
- **Admin-authored tests** appear here automatically once created in `/admin`.

### 6.7 EMoIQ — AI-Powered Smart Exam Strategy Engine (`/emoiq`)

The exam-strategy layer. Five tools, all backed by a single edge function (`supabase/functions/emoiq`) that routes actions through Gemini via the Lovable AI Gateway.

- **`/emoiq` — Hub** with all five tools.
- **`/emoiq/analyze` — PYQ Intelligence Engine.**
  - Paste past-paper text (or upload a PDF into the private `pyq-papers` bucket).
  - NLP extracts **unit-wise weightage**, **topic frequency**, **marks distribution**, **year-over-year trends**.
  - Sample output: "Unit 3 = 35% weightage, HIGH priority".
  - Saved to `pyq_analyses` under the student's account.
- **`/emoiq/predict` — Smart Question Prediction.**
  - Pick a saved analysis → **10 probability-ranked questions** (e.g. "70% chance").
  - Shows unit, mark weight, and the reason each was ranked high.
  - Saved to `predicted_questions` for later review.
- **`/emoiq/plan` — Personalized Study Plan.**
  - Inputs: subject, days left, weak topics.
  - Output: **day-by-day plan** — what to study, in what order, for how many hours.
  - **Last-24-Hour Mode** toggle → collapses into a crash-revision plan when the exam is tomorrow.
  - Explicit **skip list** so students know what to drop when time runs out.
- **`/emoiq/quiz` — Diagnostic Quiz with feedback loop.**
  - 10 adaptive MCQs across the syllabus.
  - Results write into `emoiq_weak_topics`, which the planner reads on the next run — the plan adjusts to your weak spots automatically.
- **`/emoiq/doubt` — AI Doubt Solver.**
  - Chat scoped to the current syllabus.
  - Conversations persisted in `doubt_threads` / `doubt_messages`.

### 6.8 AI Study Helper (`/ai-assistant`)

- **General-purpose AI helper** for any syllabus doubt (separate from EMoIQ's exam-scoped chat).
- Runs on the `ai-chat` edge function; Gemini key stays server-side.
- Simple language by default — asks follow-ups when the topic is too broad.

### 6.9 Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

- **Course progress** across Python / Java / C / DSA.
- **Challenge streak** and days completed.
- **Bookmarks** — saved chapters, resources, quizzes, and tests in one place.
- **Recent uploads** so students see what's new since last visit.

### 6.10 Community & content pages

- **`/join`** — Telegram (`t.me/Emo_Learners`), Instagram (`@Emolearners`), YouTube (`@EmoLearners`), founder's LinkedIn.
- **`/about`** — mission, founder's story, link to the founder's portfolio (`https://mohitahirwarportfolio.vercel.app/`).
- **`/contact`** — feedback / bug-report form wired to the `feedback` table.
- **`/internships`** — "Coming Soon" placeholder for future partner programs.
- **`/privacy-policy`** — plain-English privacy note.

### 6.11 Site-wide UX

- **Bookmarks (`src/lib/bookmarks.ts`)** on any chapter, quiz, resource, or test.
- **Feedback widget** — floating "Report a mistake" button on every page.
- **Bottom nav on mobile** — thumb-reachable Home / Learn / Practice / Notes / You.
- **Dark by default** with Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens. No hard-coded colors.
- **Framer Motion** page transitions; disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Keyboard accessible** — focus rings, skip links, ARIA labels on icon-only buttons.
- **SEO** — per-route `<head>` (title, description, OpenGraph, Twitter), semantic HTML, canonical tags, generated `/sitemap.xml`.

### 6.12 Admin panel (`/admin`) — founder-only

Access gated server-side against `FOUNDER_ADMIN_EMAIL`. The client is never trusted.

- **Upload PDFs** with drag-and-drop → tagged by branch + semester + subject.
- **Manage subjects** — add / rename / delete, aligned to the RGPV syllabus seed.
- **Manage resources** inline — edit title, tags, visibility.
- **Create & edit custom quizzes** — question, options, correct answer, per-question explanation.
- **Create & edit timed tests** — duration, total questions, negative marking, review mode toggle.
- **Feedback inbox** — every "Report a mistake" with context (page URL, user, timestamp).
- **Role management** — grant / revoke `admin` via the `user_roles` table (never on `profiles`).

### 6.13 Backend surface (developer reference)

- **Tables**: `profiles`, `user_roles`, `subjects`, `resources`, `custom_quizzes`, `custom_tests`, `feedback`, `pyq_papers`, `pyq_analyses`, `predicted_questions`, `study_plans`, `emoiq_weak_topics`, `emoiq_quiz_attempts`, `doubt_threads`, `doubt_messages`. All with RLS enabled and explicit `GRANT`s.
- **Storage buckets** (private): `study-materials`, `pyq-papers`. Signed-URL access only, minted by a server function.
- **Edge functions**: `ai-chat` (general AI helper), `emoiq` (analyze / predict / plan / quiz).
- **Server functions**: admin bootstrap, direct password reset, signed-URL minting — all Zod-validated.

## 7. How every feature helps students

This section explains how each feature solves a real study problem — not what page it lives on, but what it actually does for the student. Nothing here exists just to look nice.

### Finding the right material fast

Students waste hours scrolling through Telegram groups and WhatsApp forwards to find notes that match their syllabus. On EMO Learners, branch and semester filters align to RGPV Bhopal AICTE Flexible Curricula, so a CSE Sem-3 student sees only their subjects. A typo-tolerant search means "operatng system" still lands on Operating Systems. Subject cards show unit-by-unit breakdowns, so revision the night before an exam is structured and fast. Signed-URL downloads make every PDF private and instant — no public links that break after a week.

### Learning to code without getting lost

Long tutorial videos feel good to watch but rarely leave the student able to write real code. The courses on this platform are split into short chapters with notes, working code snippets, and a direct video link to the exact concept timestamp. The student reads first, copies the code into their own editor, and only watches the video part they did not understand. An inline quiz right after each chapter checks if the idea actually landed before the student moves on. A hands-on coding exercise then pushes them from passive watching to active building. A progress tracker always shows what is next, so coming back after a gap feels like resuming, not restarting.

### Building a daily coding habit

The 30-day Python challenge turns a vague "I want to learn Python" into a fixed daily commitment with an end date. Each day lists exactly what the student will learn and how long it takes — usually 30 to 45 minutes. A streak counter and badge system create a simple loop: the student returns not just for the lesson, but to keep the streak alive. A certificate preview at the end gives a real, shareable reward. The first few days work without an account, so a curious student can try before committing.

### Testing understanding, not just memorising

Reading notes feels productive, but real learning happens when the student tries to answer questions. Short quizzes give instant feedback with explanations, so a wrong answer becomes a lesson instead of a failure. Timed mock tests simulate real exam pressure, so the student walks into the hall with nerves already trained. A review mode after every test shows every question again with the correct answer and reasoning — most free quiz apps skip this step.

### Exam strategy that actually works

Before EMoIQ, students guessed which units to study the night before. The PYQ Intelligence Engine reads past papers and tells them which unit carries the most marks and which topics appear every year. Smart Question Prediction then gives ten concrete questions ranked by how likely they are to appear, so revision is focused instead of scattered. The personalised study plan breaks the syllabus into day-by-day tasks. A diagnostic quiz feeds weak topics back into the plan automatically, so the schedule adjusts without the student having to self-diagnose. When time runs out completely, the Last-24-Hour Mode compresses everything into a crash list of what to cover and what to skip — removing the guilt of dropping a unit when the exam is tomorrow.

### Help at 2 AM before an exam

The AI Study Helper and the EMoIQ Doubt Solver are available at any hour, in simple language that does not drown a first-year in jargon. The AI asks follow-up questions when a topic is too broad, which forces the student to narrow their own doubt — often half the battle in understanding it. Unlike generic chatbots, the doubt solver stays inside the exam syllabus, so answers are relevant and focused.

### Keeping everything in one place

Bookmarks on every chapter, quiz, resource, and test mean the student never has to remember where they left off. The dashboard shows course progress, challenge streaks, and saved material in one view. New notes and PYQs appear in a "recent uploads" section, so a daily check is enough to stay current.

### Staying connected and heard

A Telegram group and other community channels give students a place to ask questions in real time and find peers who are studying the same subjects. A feedback widget on every page lets any student flag a mistake or request a missing note, and the fix often ships the same day.

## 8. Findings — what I learned building this

- **Students don't read long text on phones.** Short, chunked notes with code blocks beat walls of paragraphs every time.
- **The single most-asked-for thing was PYQs.** Not fancy AI, not videos — previous year question papers. So they became a first-class object.
- **A quiz right after notes converts far better than a quiz on a separate page.** That's why every course chapter now has its quiz and exercise inline.
- **Streaks work.** The 30-day challenge tracker had the highest return-visits in early testing.
- **Trust matters.** Students only upload their own notes once they see the site takes security seriously (private bucket, signed URLs, real auth). That directly informed the security model.
- **Plain English wins.** Rewriting "Cyberpunk Brutalist Practice Engine" to "Quizzes with instant answers" doubled the click-through in informal testing.
